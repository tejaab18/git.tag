This authentication is usually provided by a system such as a password, PIN code, or card reader. Biometric data such as fingerprints and retinal scans are used in several places. Everything is designed with a purpose. To verify an individual's identity. EEG-based authentication is an addition to a wide range of authentication systems that have many advantages over other authentication systems.
User authentication has always been an integral part of any security system. Even though biometric authentication has long been the gold standard of security, as technology advances, even biometric authentication technology is not safe from forgery and deception. Biometric using several channels of electroencephalogram (EEG) data available at the interface (BCI). 
Authentication can be done quickly and easily by capturing a defined brain state that cannot be evoked by assertion or coercion, nor replicated by a non-living brain, because every human brain has a distinctive neural signature. People with disabilities cannot use systems that use fingerprints or retinal scans, but they can use systems that use brain waves. This made it clear that using EEG as a biometric for authentication would be very beneficial.
A system will be developed and implemented that will allow users to set their brain wave patterns. This must be provided as an unlock pattern to access. This pattern is an arbitrary combination of blinking, attention, and various brain rhythms such as alpha, beta, theta, and delta. The system described in this document offers two-factor authentication. The first level of this is EEG. Once the correct pattern of brain signals is provided, the system requests a passkey for second level authentication.
